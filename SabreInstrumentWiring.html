<h2 id="Sabre_Instrument_Wiring">Sabre Instrument Wiring</h2>
<p class="line862">As reported from one SabMag list member: There is a small circuit board inside the instrument panel. It is about 2 inches by 2 inches [ 5cm by 5 cm ] in size. There are 4 wires going to that circuit board with the following colors: <ul><li>Yellow / Blue Goes to CLOCK SET Button </li><li>Yellow / Red Goes to CLOCK SET Button </li><li>Yellow / Green Goes to CLOCK SET Button </li><li>Green / Black GROUND Wire <ul><li>Note:  The CLOCK SET BUTTON is located on the panel between the handle bars. Also have Check; Lamp Reset; and Trip Reset nearby. </li></ul></li></ul><p class="line874">There are two others wires associated with the CLOCK circuit. They are located in the plastic housing near the Clutch and choke actuator. The Sabre has a feature called Elapsed Time Clock. It can be used for timing how long it takes to get from point A to point B. For example: from mile marker 1 to mile marker 2. A switch at this housing controls whether you are in CLOCK MODE or Elapsed Time Mode. This select-switch has 3 wires going to it: <ul><li>Green GROUND </li><li>Red / Blue Goes to MAIN circuit board in Instrument Cluster </li><li>Yellow / Blue Goes to MAIN circuit board in Instrument Cluster </li></ul><p class="line874">I have a VF750S UK [ United  Kingdom ] Model , Colorized Wiring Schematic. It is hard to decipher the Power wires that you need identified. There appear to be a few that go into the instrument cluster and the related CLOCK circuit board ... <ul><li>Black / Brown appears to be a power wire as it comes from the fuse box </li><li>Yellow / Red appears to be a power wire </li><li>Red / Blue appears to be a power wire </li><li>Yellow / Black appears to be a power wire </li><li>Red is a power wire coming from the main 30A fuse </li></ul><p class="line874">EXAMPLES: Black / Brown is a Black wire with a brown stripe <p class="line874">Yellow / Red is a Yellow wire with a red stripe <p class="line874">Red / Yellow is a Red wire with a yellow stripe <p class="line874">BEFORE going into the Instrument Cluster again; you may want to check the wiring in the small electrical panel between the handlebars. <ul><li>Check the wiring for the CLOCK SET switch for good connections. </li><li>Next check the wiring in the wiring-box that is located on the left handlebar. <ul><li>Open it up and check the wiring for the CLOCK and ELAPSED TIME toggling switch. </li></ul></li><li>Then go into the instrument panel for a check of those wires. <ul><li>I think that the Black / Brown wire might prove out to be the power wire that feeds the clock. </li><li><p class="line862">The Black / Brown wire feeds power to the TACH; FUEL &amp; TEMP UNIT; NEUTRAL LIGHT and SPEEDOMETER as well as the TRIP CLOCK circuit. </li><li>From what I can decipher; any color code with GREEN in it appears to be a return path or GROUNDING wire. </li></ul></li><li>It may well be that your Clock Instrument is toast. If power is getting to it and its' ground wire is okay...... then it simply doesn't work anymore </li></ul><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
