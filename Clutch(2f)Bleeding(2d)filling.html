<p class="line874">When filling a drained hydraulic system, I always reverse-fill the system.  This virtually eliminates air bubbles getting trapped in the line as it pushes the air out of the system from the bottom up. <ul><li style="list-style-type:none">This is how...

Caution, it takes very little fluid to fill the lines once the slave cylinder is full. </li><li>After the pressure has subsided, check the MC.  If it is not full, pressurize the Mity-Vac again.  It takes about 1/2 cup to fill the lines - so you want about 3/4 cup of brake fluid. </li><li>Once the MC has some fluid in it, and there is no pressure from the Mity-Vac, close the bleeder valve and remove the hose from the bleeder valve. </li><li>Fill the MC up to the line with brake fluid and you are good to go. </li></ul><p class="line867"><span class="u">Notes:<strong> </strong></span><strong> </strong> <ul><li><p class="line891"><em>You may have to burp the banjo bolt, but it is usually not necessary.</em> </li><li><p class="line891"><em>This method can be used to push the old fluid up to the MC, but then you have to periodically remove the fluid from the MC.
