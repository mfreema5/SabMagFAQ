<p class="line862">The premature cam wear that plagued early SabMags can be prevented by modifying the engine oiling system to supply more oil to the valve train.  There are a variety of ways to do a 'Oil Mod'.  It's recommended that you verify the oil pressure after doing any oil mod, since a few instances of low oil pressure after a mod are reported. (See <a href="./Oil.html#CheckOilPressure">Oil: Checking Pressure</a>) <p class="line874">Why not just tee off of the oil pressure switch? Other list members have made pressure measurements at this engine point and have concluded that the pressure and volume is not sufficient to solve the oiling problem. <p class="line867">
