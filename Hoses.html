<ul><li>An alternative to Honda hoses is 7/8" heater hose, if you can find it. This will serve for the straight ones, but the ones on the water pump are too sharply bent. </li><li>Car Quest part no. 21517 = 15/16" $20. This hose is shaped like a stretched Z with a little bend in the middle. </li><li>Next is Car Quest part no. 20566 = 1" U-shaped hose. This hose not only has the correct diameter bend, but has the correct twist to connect the water pump to the sub frame. <ul><li style="list-style-type:none">o With some fit, cut, fit, cut these work very well. Dry run tests point to the following method of installation: </li><li style="list-style-type:none">. * Put the hose on the sub-frame.  Don't clamp and leave the water pump end free <ul><li>Slide the return hose onto and up the chrome pipe (remember this is 15/16") </li><li>Connect the return hose to the water pump and clamp </li><li>Clamp chrome pipe end </li><li>Align and clamp to sub-frame </li><li>Slide on and connect to water pump <ul><li>Installation note. After trimming the pump-sub frame hose down to the correct length, I was able to install the return hose completely, then the pump hose completely. No sliding one up the chrome pipe, etc </li></ul></li><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line891"><em>Here's another lil' tip... when cutting these hoses... nothing better than a band saw with a sharp blade. Trim a little, try, trim a little, and try again. No cutting with a knife or hack saw. You will have to blow the black dust out of the hose each time before fitting it, then sweep yer garage floor. # . If you use the top corner with the longer end, you get the Thermostat to cross connect hose. If you use start at the mid point and cut at the bottom corner, you get the return hose from the chrome pipe to the water pump. The little bend in the pipe just works to clear the water pump to sub-fame hose.</em> </li></ul></ul></ul><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
