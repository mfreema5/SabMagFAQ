<p class="line867">
<h3 id="Problems">Problems</h3>
<p class="line874">The connectors overheat due to corrosion in the connector plug contact surfaces. <p class="line874">The two pieces of metal inside the connectors only allow for a small surface area in making the connection.  In clean condition, there is just enough contact surface area to handle the electrical load. <p class="line874">If the contact area shrinks due to corrosion, then the same amount of electricity that was going through a larger contact area is now being forced to go through a smaller contact area.  A byproduct of this is heat.  This heat fosters more corrosion - which further reduces the contact surface area - which causes more heat - a Catch-22. <p class="line874">Eventually the connections heat up so much that they melt and cause issues. <p class="line867">
<h3 id="Preventing_Corrosion">Preventing Corrosion</h3>
<p class="line874">It has been recommended to do this once a year, or twice a year if commuting in a place where they regularly salt the roads in the winter. <ul><li>Disconnect the connector </li><li>Spritz with contact cleaner </li><li>Spritz with silicone spray </li><li>Reconnect </li></ul><p class="line867">

<h4 id="Blade_Connectors">Blade Connectors</h4>
<p class="line874">Carefully take apart each connector and spray the dirt out with the contact cleaner. <p class="line874">Remove each wire from the connector, clean the male blade connector with the eraser and the wash off with the contact cleaner. Only remove and clean one wire at a time. That way you won't forget where it goes back. <p class="line874">Very carefully tighten the curl on the edges of the female connector. If there is any corrosion clean it out with a small piece of 300 grit sandpaper. The corrosion in the blade connectors is the major cause of connector meltdown. <p class="line874">If there appears to be corrosion where the wire is crimped to the connector, you can use a small wattage soldering iron and resin core solder to solder it. Don't over cook it. <p class="line874">Squirt a blob of high temperature silicone grease in the connector before putting it back together and you should eliminate most problems. <p class="line867">
<h4 id="Hitachi_.28OEM.29_Connectors">Hitachi (OEM) Connectors</h4>
<p class="line874">You can disassemble the connectors by depressing the brass "dog" that holds them in. <p class="line874">Cut any heavy corrosion with the sandpaper then finish up with the contact cleaner. <p class="line874">Spray with silicone spray and reassemble <p class="line867">
