<p class="line874">It is believed that the Side Gear Case will not come off because it cannot clear the cross-shaft. There is actually a .001 inch clearance between the two, so it's just a matter of knowing how to get the case to clear the cross-shaft and pop off. Here's what is involved: <ul><li>Remove the rear wheel, final drive, drive shaft, and swingarm. </li><li>Remove the Cross-shaft Bearing Holder (#10 in picture) by removing the 4 bolts </li><li>Drain the coolant and remove the water pump and slave cylinder </li><li><p class="line862">Remove all the bolts holding the Side Gear Case with the exception of the 3 Clutch Cover Stay Bolts (#16 &amp; 17 in picture) <ul><li><p class="line862">Loosen these(#16 &amp; #17), but only back them out half way </li></ul></li><li>Now pull on the Side Gear Case (#6 in picture) until it separates from the engine. It will only come out about 1/2 inch before it hits on the cross shaft. <ul><li>Use a pry bar or block of wood behind the Side Gear Case to hold it out away from the engine </li></ul></li><li>Tap on the 3 Clutch Cover Stay Bolts one at a time. This will push the cross shaft back and out of the Side Gear Case. <ul><li>Continue to tap these bolts (and back them off as necessary) until the cross shaft clears the Side Gear Case </li><li>Now you can remove these 3 bolts and remove the Side Gear Case for oil seal replacement </li></ul></li><li>When you are ready to reinstall, Insert and tighten the 3 Clutch Cover Stay Bolts first. This will allow the cross shaft to slip back into the Side Gear Case </li></ul><p class="line867">
<h3 id="Some_part_numbers_for_this_job_.28V65_Magna.29:">Some part numbers for this job (V65 Magna):</h3>
<ul><li>91204-MB0-013 "oil seal 8x25x8" This is the seal that we are replacing and is located behind the clutch slave cylinder inside the Side Gear Case. </li><li>91209-MB0-003 "oil seal, 8x18x5 " This is inside the slave cylinder and is replaced when rebuilding the slave cylinder. </li><li>91204-425-003 "oil seal, 12.5x25x8" This one seals the shifter shaft. Replace if leaking or if you don't want to do it later. </li><li>21291-MB0-306 "gasket, side gear" This is the gasket that goes between the Side Gear Case and the engine and will need to be replaced with this job. </li><li>91305-422-000 "o-ring, 9.8x2.4" This o-ring goes behind the Side Gear Case. Probably doesn't need to be replaced but might as well since you have it apart. </li><li>91308-MB0-003 "o-ring, 5.7x2.2" This o-ring goes behind the Side Gear Case. Probably doesn't need to be replaced but might as well since you have it apart. </li><li>91314-MJ0-000 "o-ring, 3x70" This is the o-ring that goes between the Cross-shaft Bearing Holder and the Side Gear Case.
