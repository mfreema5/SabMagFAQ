<h2 id="Clutch_Push-rod_Seal">Clutch Push-rod Seal</h2>
<p class="line874">Repaired my seal early November.  Cost of the seal was $4.00 Canadian taxes in. The part number was (is) 91204-MB0-013 - oil seal 8mm x 25mm x 8mm. This is for an 83 Magna V45. <p class="line874">I did it the way Jason had fixed Kevin's bike.  I believe it was termed the "keyhole" method. <p class="line874">I ground the lip down at the 12 and 6 o'clock positions (using a Dremal with the rotory drill for soft metal), and pushed the seal in with a screw driver and removed it with a pair of surgical forceps  (think very fine needle nose plyers.  I cleaned everything up, then prepared to insert the new seal. <p class="line874">I noticed a flat area at the 3 o'clock area that needed to have the seal slipped into before pulling it home.  I first coated some blue locktite on the outside of the seal and slid it into the hole.  Using the forseps inserted into the middle hole of the seal, I manipulated it into place.  To pull it home, I inserted a Allen wrench into the hole, and using a vice grip to pull on the Allen wrench I was able to pull it with a couple of tugs and seat the seal.  I think the lock tight helped to lubricate it and make it slide easier. <p class="line874">All and all it took about 1/2 hour.  It took longer to bleed the air out of the clutch! <p class="line874">Here is a page with the "regular" fix. <a class="http" href="http://www.hamjudo.com/ek/smclutch.htm">http://www.hamjudo.com/ek/smclutch.htm</a> <p class="line874">Here is a picture of Kevin's fix using the "keyhole" method. <a class="http" href="http://good-times.webshots.com/photo/2966483180101281273kEFuXC?vhost=good-times">http://good-times.webshots.com/photo/2966483180101281273kEFuXC?vhost=good-times</a> <p class="line874">This is for clutch pushrod seal on the engine side of the clutch slave assembly. <p class="line874">The clutch slave cylinder side is a different matter.  If the small seal in the center of the cylinder needs replacing, just pull it out and replace it, but in reality I don't think it does much but center the rod.  I replaced all my seals on the clutch slave assembly at the same time as cost was minimal and was easy to do.  The assembly was clean otherwise and needed no further service other than to flush the old new fluid and to be bled. <p class="line867">

<p class="line874">In theory, you can simply remove two "notches" from around the seal, then rotate it 90 degrees and pull it out sideways through the notch.  The new seal can be installed the same way.  This is the "keyhole" method. <p class="line867"><img alt="Notched.jpg" class="attachment" src="attachments/ClutchPushrodSeal/Notched.jpg" title="Notched.jpg" /> <p class="line874">If the "keyhole" method doesn't work for you, go for the classic method: just Dremel off the whole lip. <p class="line867"><img alt="CompletelyRemoved.jpg" class="attachment" src="attachments/ClutchPushrodSeal/CompletelyRemoved.jpg" title="CompletelyRemoved.jpg" /> <span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
