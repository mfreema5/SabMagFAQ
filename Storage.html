<p class="line874">Use the blue or "Marine" Sta-Bil fuel stabilizer. <p class="line874">All of the following are for the very anal. <ol type="1"><li>Wash, dry,  and wax the bike thoroughly. </li><li>Drain the  coolant, flush the system, and add new coolant. </li><li>Put some gas  stabilizer in the tank (available at auto part stores).   Also make sure the tank is as full  as possible. </li><li>Ride the bike  until it's warmed up. </li><li>Change the  oil and filter. </li><li>Lube the  chain. (Shafties take a break.) </li><li>Turn off the  fuel petcock. </li><li>Drain the  carb fuel bowls. </li><li>Remove the  air filter. </li><li>Remove the  spark plugs. Inject a small amount of 2-stroke oil into each cylinder. Crank the  motor a few times. </li><li>Replace the  spark plugs and air filter. </li><li>Seal the air  intakes with duct tape to keep out mice etc. </li><li>Remove the  battery and put it on a trickle charger in a warm place. </li><li>Put the bike  on the centerstand and block it up so the front tire also is off the ground. </li><li>Spray some  WD40 into the exhaust pipes. This absorbs water and puts a nice oil coating on  the insides of the exhaust system. </li><li>Seal the ends of  the mufflers with plastic bags. </li><li>Put some  silicon preservative on a rag and wipe down all the rubber  pieces except for the grips, pegs, and  tires. </li><li>Lube all  cables and moving gizmos like foot pegs, levers, etc. </li><li>Bleed the brakes and  clutch. </li><li>Cover with a  breathable cover. Honda suggests that if the bike is  going to be in storage for more then 4  months, you change the oil again when you get it  out. If you do that, you might as well put cheap oil in  for the winter, and replace it in the  spring with good oil. (Some list members think  this is a waste.) No reason to change the oil filter twice though. </li></ol><p class="line874">If you don't "store" the bike and decide to start up the bike during the cold season, be sure to ride it around 20 minutes or so to get the engine hot enough to burn off the condensation/contaminants in the engine/oil.  Idling the bike in your driveway can do more harm than good. <span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
