<p class="line862">This report from one list member concerning use of the K&amp;N Nighthawk/Magna bars on V65 Magnas: "My first installation of these bars was on a 1984 V65 Magna. The hydraulic cables fit OK, but they were kind of tight when the handlebar was turned to one extreme. I had to loosen the clutch line from its clamp on the frame to alleviate the stress. When the handlebars were turned all the way to the left, there was a slight tension on the throttle cables, which increased the engine RPM by about 100. I decided to live with it. Also, the stock Honda handlebars have a little hole near the end. Into this hole fits a little protrusion from the choke/horn assembly to keep it from rotating. Instead of drilling a new hole in the handlebars, I just bent the tab back, and put some high friction tape on the handlebars at the spot where the hole was. This worked out OK. None of the wiring presented any difficulty. I used this configuration for about 1 year, approximately 25,000 miles, with no difficulty. <p class="line862">Since then, I have added braided steel hydraulic lines, which I had made 2" longer than stock. Those worked better than the stock lines. With the braided lines (and unchanged throttle) I rode for another year approximately 30,000 miles. On my 1986, I noticed that the clutch and brake master cylinder were different from those on the 1984. The fitting came out the front, not the side as in the 1984. I installed the same handlebars on the 1986, with the lengthened braided steel lines from the hospitalized 1984. I don't know what difference the repositioning of the hydraulic line output would make with stock lines, but it seems that it would slightly alleviate the stress upon handlebar extremes. On the 1986 I kept the stock throttle &amp; choke cables, which causes it to be just as tight (at extremes) as the 1984. The only time it has any affect is when I turn the handlebars fully to the left. This rarely happens to me in any type of riding. When I first bought the 1986 V65, I wanted bars that had a really long pullback, for comfort. I bought these from Flanders Co.; I don't recall the P/N. I also bought lengthened throttle cables, from Flanders. Actually, I sent them cables, and they lengthened them for me for about $15 ea. I rode with the long pullback bars for a while, but I felt they were too narrow. The width was only 29" or so, and with the very long pullback, it put my hands in a very uncomfortable position. <p class="line862">I went back to the K&amp;N ones. I am debating whether to buy wider bars with a longer pullback, such as Dennis Kirk P/N 59-48 [Honda 750-900 Custom], since I already have the lengthened throttle cables. Only the future will tell. The K&amp;N Magna handlebars, if you are mechanically inclined, should go on without much difficulty in a few hours of your time. If you go any larger, you will definitely have to modify your cables, including both throttles, choke, clutch line, and at least your upper front brake line. The cable modification is not that difficult a task. Flanders Co. in California was very helpful and informative, and they have a free catalog. Flanders can be reached at 800-423-4483." <p class="line862">Daytona Touring handlebars are often used and are almost identical to the the discontinued K&amp;N superbike bars.  Daytona Touring handlebars will give the rider a "slight" forward lean.  OEM cables may have to be rerouted, but shorter ones do not necessarily need to be ordered.  Depending upon the year Magna, you own, the MC could be angled.  Functionality of the MC at this angle is unaffected as the banjo bolt is still the lowest point of the MC.  Mirrors now show your shoulders.  The mirror stems can be bent at about a 90 degree angle for better viewing.  Sabre or Interceptor MC's perfectly fit on this handlebar.  Just note if the clutch MC has the slot for the choke lever.  Be careful that the 90 degree brass choke cable doesn't hit your tank at full left lock.  You may have to <a href="./Carburetors(2f)Choke(20)Relocation.html">relocate your choke</a>. <p class="line874">Daytona handlebars on V65 Magna ... <p class="line867"><img alt="V65 Daytona_Handlebars1.jpg" class="attachment" src="attachments/Handlebars/V65%20Daytona_Handlebars1.jpg" title="V65 Daytona_Handlebars1.jpg" /> <img alt="V65 Daytona_Handlebars2.jpg" class="attachment" src="attachments/Handlebars/V65%20Daytona_Handlebars2.jpg" title="V65 Daytona_Handlebars2.jpg" /> <p class="line874">(Pics per a65bug) <p class="line867">

<p class="line867"><span class="u">V45 Sabre ('82 and '83 in the US and '82 to '85 in Canada)</span> <p class="line874">Because the bars are clip-on style, the options in changing them are limited. <p class="line874">For a lower bar, you can mount them below the triple clamp. If one mounts the stock handlebars below the triple clamp, you will have  to limit the side to side sweep  or "swing" of the forks or the bars  will damage the fuel tank before swinging to full lock position, and you  loose the ability to use the integral fork lock.  Other than some  minor maneuvering  at parking lot speeds, this works out fine. <p class="line874">The 500 Interceptor clip-on's are a direct replacement fit, do  not require any shortening up of the fork sweep, and although the Sabre has bulkier switch gear, all the control  pods can be coaxed into position with a little bit of adjustment of both  their position on the forks and the instrument panel - after you remove  the underside locating bolt or pin.  The 750 Interceptor had a larger fork tube, so it won't work. <p class="line874">Novella sells a bracket to convert to a tube bar, but space between the fork legs is used up by the odometer and accessory switches. While you could use a tube bar with this, you would have to cut out the center section, in essence making your own clip-ons. Novella (847-359-2666) also sells clip on bars for a variety of fork diameters, but space for mounting the switch gear remains a concern. <p class="line874">500 Interceptor clip-ons on V45 Sabre ... <p class="line867"><img alt="DSC_0342_small.jpg" class="attachment" src="attachments/Handlebars/DSC_0342_small.jpg" title="DSC_0342_small.jpg" /> <img alt="DSC_0343_small.jpg" class="attachment" src="attachments/Handlebars/DSC_0343_small.jpg" title="DSC_0343_small.jpg" /> <img alt="DSC_0344_small.jpg" class="attachment" src="attachments/Handlebars/DSC_0344_small.jpg" title="DSC_0344_small.jpg" /> <p class="line874">(Pics per Mark Wolf) <p class="line867"><span class="u">V65 Sabre</span> <p class="line874">The bars are 3-part adjustable.  If the bars needed to be lowered, the riser portion can be cut.  However, Honda Nighhawk 700s handlebars are a direct swap-in with no cutting involved.  The bar position is down and further forward for a more aggressive riding position. <p class="line862">V65 Sabre top, 700S Nighthawk bottom <img alt="nighthawkbars.jpg" class="attachment" src="attachments/Handlebars/nighthawkbars.jpg" title="nighthawkbars.jpg" /> <span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
