<h2 id="Brake_Lines">Brake Lines</h2>
<p class="line874">(All price info is likely out of date.) <p class="line874">Check the hoses for cracks. It's rare for one to fail, but they are after all 20 years or more old. Consider replacing them with braided stainless lines, which can improve brake feel because they swell less under pressure. <p class="line874">These are available in kit form from Russell, or you can buy components and make up your own. The Russell ones cost about the same as factory replacements, around $165. One thing about these: you occasionally get one with a banjo fitting that doesn't quite line up, putting a twist in the line. Braided lines don't like this, so it should be returned for one that fits correctly. See PARTS and/or CAMS below for sources of hose and fittings to make your own; list members report good results using AN-3 line and appropriate fittings. (Apparently there is a wide variety of bends and angles for the banjo bolt fittings when you use #3 line.) Another alternative is to take the old lines to a hydraulic equipment supplier that handles the necessary components and have them make up a set. <p class="line867">
<h2 id="Dave_Dodge">Dave Dodge</h2>
<p class="line874">"I can provide ready-to-bolt-on hoses in any length. Determine the hose you want, and how much longer it needs to be and I can make it for you. I can bundle it in a kit, or sell you only the single hose. Single hoses from a 3-hose kit sell for $36.00. If the bike has only one front disc and a single hose, the price is $49.00 (because it is longer and has chrome ends). My hoses are DOT approved." <p class="line867">
<h2 id="Galfer">Galfer</h2>
<p class="line862">Galfer-USA (<a class="mailto" href="mailto:galfer@silcom.com">galfer@silcom.com</a> or 800-685-6633) <p class="line874">They said it was $95 for any custom lines. They had them to us next day (they are only about 55 miles from the house so it was quicker than you East-coasters can expect). <p class="line867">
<h2 id="Sandro">Sandro</h2>
<p class="line874">Sandro quoted me $85 for a two-line kit, and $42.50 for the single line one on the rear. <p class="line874">All banjo fittings seem to have about a 20-25 degree bend to them at both the master cylinder and caliper ends; I'll have to get the exact degrees to request from Sandro tomorrow. He'll stick a "Y" banjo fitting at the front master cylinder for the 2-line conversion. <p class="line874">Front left line: 45.5 inches <p class="line874">Front right line: 48.5 inches <p class="line874">Rear line: 18 inches <p class="line874">These measurements are for the hoses themselves, and do not include the banjo fittings. Be careful to specify this, as someone might assume you're including the banjo bolts and take off a couple inches. All banjo fittings have a *12* degree bend to them at both the master cylinder and caliper ends, not a 20 degree bend as I guessed. <p class="line874">He'll stick a *double* banjo fitting at the front master cylinder for the 2-line conversion, instead of a "Y" fitting as I thought. Turnaround time is one day from when you give him your order. They can't process a phone credit card order, so they usually ship next-day UPS COD.  <span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
