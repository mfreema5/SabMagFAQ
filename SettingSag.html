<p class="line867"><strong>Reproduced from              <a class="http" href="http://www.race-tech.com">race-tech.com</a></strong> <p class="line867"><em>What's all this ruckus about                                     suspension these days? It seems everyone is clued in that suspension setup can                                          be a key to riding fast and safely, but how do you do it? No matter what shock                                          or fork you have, they all require proper adjustment to work to their maximum                                   potential. Suspension tuning isn't rocket science, and if you follow                                    step-by-step procedures you can make remarkable improvements in your bike's                                     handling characteristics.</em> <p class="line874">The first step to setting up any bike is to set                                          the spring sag and determine if you have the correct-rate springs. Spring sag                                   is the amount the springs compress between fully topped out and fully loaded                                    with the rider on board in riding position. It is also referred to as static                                    ride height or static sag. My company, Race Tech, (909/594-7755) has an                                         advanced method of checking spring sag that I'll describe. <p class="line867"><em>If                                       you've ever measured sag before, you may have noticed that if you check it                                      three or four times, you can get three or four times, you can get three or four                                         different numbers without changed anything. We'll tell you why this occurs and                                          how to handle it. </em> <p class="line867"><strong>REAR END</strong> <p class="line862">1. Extend the                                      suspension completely by getting the wheel off the ground. It helps to have a                                   few friends around. On bikes with sidestands the bike can usually be                                    <em>carefully</em> rocked up on the stand to unload the suspension. Most race                                        stands will not work because the suspension will still be loaded by resting on                                          the swingarm rather than the wheel. Measure the distance from the axle                                          <em>vertically</em> to some point on the chassis (metric figures are easiest and                                     more precise; <em>Figure 1). </em>Mark this reference point because you'll need                                      to refer to it again. This measurement is L1. If the measurement is not exactly                                         vertical the sag numbers will be inaccurate (too low). <p class="line862">2. Take the bike off the stand and put the rider on board                                   in riding position. Have a third person balance the bike from the front. If                                     accuracy is important to you, you <em>must</em> take friction of the linkage into                                    account. This is where our procedure is different: We take <em>two</em>                                      additional measurements. First, push down on the rear end about 25mm (1") and                                   let it extend <em>very slowly</em>. <ul><li>Where it stops, measure the distance between the axle and the                                    mark on chassis again. If there were no drag in the linkage the bike would come                                         up a little further. It's important that you do not bounce! This measurement is                                         L2. </li></ul><p class="line874">3. Have your assistant lift up on the rear of the bike                                      about 25mm and let it down very slowly. Where it stops, measure it. If there                                    were no drag it would drop a little further. Remember, don't bounce! This                                       measurement it L3. <p class="line874">4. The spring sag is in the middle of these two                                     measurements. In fact, if there were no drag in the linkage, L2 and L3 would be                                         the same. To get the actual sag figure you find the midpoint by averaging the                                   two numbers and subtracting them from the fully extended measurement L1: static                                         spring sag=L1 -[(L2 + L3) / 2]. <p class="line874">5. Adjust the preload with whatever method applies to                                       your bike. Spring collars are common, and some benefit from the use of special                                          tools. In a pinch you can use a blunt chisel to unlock the collars and turn the                                         main adjusting collar. If you have too much sag you need more preload; if you                                   have too little sag you need less preload. For road race bikes, rear sag is                                     typically 25 to 30mm. Street riders usually use 30 to 35mm. Bikes set up for                                    the track are compromise when ridden on the street. The firmer settings                                         commonly used on the tract are generally not recommended (or desirable) for                                     road work. <ul><li>You might notice the Sag Master measuring tool (available from                                   Race Tech) in the pictures. It's a special tool made to assist you in measuring                                         sag by allowing you to read sag directly without subtracting. It can also be                                    used as a standard tape measure. </li></ul><p class="line874">Measuring front-end sag is very similar to the rear. However,                                    it' much more critical to take seal drag into account on the front end because                                          it is more pronounced. <p class="line867"><strong>FRONT END</strong> <p class="line862">1. Extend the                                       fork completely and measure from the wiper (the dust seal atop the slider) to                                   the bottom of the triple clamp (or lower fork casting on inverted forks;                                        <em>Figure 2</em>). This measurement is L1. <p class="line862">2. Take the bike off the sidestand, and put the rider on                                    board in riding position. Get and assistant to balance the bike from the rear,                                          then push down on the front end and let it extend <em>very slowly</em>. <ul><li><p class="line891"><a class="nonexistent" href="" title="Upload new attachment &quot;MeasureSag.gif&quot;"><img alt="" height="32" src="/moin_static1910/modern/img/attach.png" title="" width="32" /></a> </li><li><p class="line862">Where                                     it stops, measure the distance between the wiper and the bottom of the triple                                   clamp again. Do not bounce. This measurement is L2.<strong> </strong> </li></ul><p class="line862">3. Lift up on the front end and let it drop <em>very                                      slowly</em>. Where it stops, measure again. Don't bounce. This measurement is                                      L3. Once again, L2 and L3 are different due to stiction or drag in the seals                                    and bushings, which is particularly high for telescopic front ends. <p class="line874">4. Just as with the front, halfway between L2 and L3 is                                         where the sag would be with no drag or stiction. Therefore L2 and L3 must be                                    averaged and subtracted from L1 to calculate true spring sag: static spring                                     sag=L1 - [l2 + l3) / 2]. <p class="line874">5. To adjust sag use the preload adjusters, if available,                                       or vary the length of the preload spaces inside the fork. <p class="line867"><strong>Street bikes run between 25 and 33 percent of their total                                        travel, which equates to 30 to 35mm. Roadrace bikes usually run between 25 and                                          30mm.</strong> <p class="line874">This method of checking sag and taking stiction into account                                     also allows you to check the drag of the linkage and seals. It follows that the                                         greater the difference between the measurements (pushing down and pulling up),                                          the worse the stiction. A good linkage (rear sag) has less than 3mm (0.12")                                     difference, and a bad one has more than 10mm (0.39"). Good forks have less than                                         15mm difference, and we've seen forks with more than 50mm. (Gee, I wonder why                                   they're harsh?) <p class="line874">It's important to stress that there is no magic number. If you                                   like the feel of the bike with less or more sag than these guidelines, great.                                   Your personal sag and front-to-rear sag bias will depend on chassis geometry,                                   track or road conditions, tire selection and rider weight and riding                                    preference. <p class="line874">Using different sag front and rear will have huge effect on                                      steering characteristics. More sag on the front or less sag on the rear will                                    make the bike turn more slowly. Increasing sag will also decrease bottoming                                     resistance, though spring rate has a bigger effect than sag. Racers often use                                   less sag to keep the bike clearance, and since roadraces work greater than we                                   see on the street, they require a stiffer setup. Of course, setting spring sag                                          is only first step of dialing in your suspension, so stay tuned for future                                      articles on spring rates and damping. <p class="line874">-Paul Thede <p class="line867">
