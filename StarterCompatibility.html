<p class="line867"><strong>Compatibility</strong> <p class="line874">From a list member: <p class="line862">The fiche shows the 82 through 87 750/700 Sabres and Magnas have interchangeable starters.  The chain-drive bikes spin the opposite way so stay away from Interceptors or 500 Magna starters.  The numbers are a bit different for the 1100cc SabMags so I suppose they're slightly different (maybe bigger). Compatible part numbers: 31200-MB0-008  31200-MB0-405  31200-MN0-008 New price at Honda Suzuki North <p class="line867"><strong>Rebuilding</strong> <p class="line874">V65 Sabre Starter Rebuild:  <a class="http" href="http://www.netcrafting.com/motorcycles/sabre/starter_rebuild.htm">http://www.netcrafting.com/motorcycles/sabre/starter_rebuild.htm</a> <p class="line862">From Rider magazine's tech Q&amp;A: <p class="line874">Q: I am the owner of a 1985 Honda V65 Sabre with a starter  motor that is going bad. I spoke with my local dealer, who shocked me with the  price of a new starter-approximately $300! When I asked about getting it  rebuilt, they did not recommend it, stating that rebuilt starters do not last. I  do not need a starter that will last another 13 years, but a couple of years  would be nice. Do you have any recommendations on this and if so, do you know  who can do the rebuild?A: I recommend that you or a competent friend do the  re-build. If you can change the oil and filter on your bike, you can repair the  starter motor. It's not that difficult, and besides-what do you have to lose?  With a lot of bikes, just getting the starter out can be a nightmare. In the  case of the V-four Honda it's a snap, as it's held to the front of the engine  with two 6mm bolts, and if it takes you more than two minutes to pull it out,  you're dragging your feet. Don't worry about the hole in the crankcase it slides  into-no oil is going to run out. Here's the one great truth about all motorcycle  starter motors: they're all shockingly expensive. What's more, few parts are  available separately for them, and in some models, none at all. Compared to  some, that $300 you were quoted is a bargain. However, most manufacturers at  least offer a carbon brush-plate assembly, because that's the item that usually  wears out. <p class="line874">For the V65 the part number's 31206-VM5-008. It sells for  about $16. Your bike's starter is held together by two long Phillips screws  joining caps at either end to the outer casing. Before disassembly, I recommend  making reference marks where the end caps join the casing, because they're only  go back together one way and finding that one way can take ages. Fingernail  polish or scratch marks will make reassembly much easier. Gently tap or pry off  the end caps-stay after it, they will come off. In each end cap is a small  bearing that supports the spinning armature. Make careful note of any shims or  thrust washers stuck to these bearings with old grease or carbon dust. Lay  everything out in the order it came apart. Now blast all components squeaky  clean with brake or electrical cleaner for a thorough examination. Worn out  brushes will be obvious. You might even find a cracked soldered connection as  the cause of your woes everything in a starter motor is pretty simple, except  for the armature. It can have a broken internal winding that's impossible to  see, so run it over to your local automotive machine shop or starter motor  repair facility for testing. If they give it the thumbs up, have them chuck the  armature in a lathe to dress down the end that the carbon brushes ride on,  because it will be hour-glass-shaped. If all of this work costs you more than  $10 I'd be surprised. Solder in the new brush plate and lightly grease the inner  race of the end-cap bearings. If two small planetary gears are employed in one  end cap, grease them, too. Reassemble everything and test the starter on the  bench with jumper cables and your bike's battery. Attach the negative cable to  the body of the starter and the positive cable to the hot input post. Don't be  alarmed by a few sparks as you touch the post-just make sure nothing combustible  (including the battery) is nearby The starter motor should rock and spin hard  when 12 volts are directly applied to it. No, a rebuilt starter motor won't last  like a new one. But for less than US$30 and an afternoon's work it will last  long enough.Rider / April 1998 <ul><li><p class="line891"><a href="./Starter_Clutch_Repair_Video.html">Starter_Clutch_Repair_Video</a> </li><li>A 22 cartridge is an exact replacement for the stock Honda cap in the starter clutch.
