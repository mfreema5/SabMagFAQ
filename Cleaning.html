<ul><li>Drain the frame tube and reinstall the drain bolt. remove the radiator, send that out. </li><li>Make your mixture of Â¼ bottle lime-away or whatever in a large bottle. a 2L soda bottle should be acceptable </li><li>Remove the engine block drain bolts (under the front bank. refer to your manual) </li><li>Remove the water pump drain bolt (refer to manual for location) </li><li>Once it's completely drained, send some water via garden hose through the system, let drain again, reinstall these bolts </li><li>Cap off the hose coming from the frame tube (left side) </li><li>With a funnel and your 2L bottle, fill the system with your cleaning solution through the hose leading from the thermostat housing TO the coolant pipes. <ul><li>It's important that you don't try to fill it THROUGH the thermostat housing. Why? Because the stat is closed. </li></ul></li><li>Fill it to the top, then shake the bike a bit to work the air bubbles out.  Fill - shake, fill - shake, until you feel confident that it's full. </li><li>Plug the hose and wait approx 24hrs </li><li>Drain everything and leave the drain bolts/plugs out.  Hold a garden hose to the hose coming off the frame tube (left side). </li><li>Flush flush flush...once the water looks clear, reinstall drain bolts. </li><li>With the hose still attached, start the bike and rev it up a bit, keep the water going full blast.  Do this for a minute or two and shut the bike down. <ul><li>If the water is clear, you're good to go.  If it is still dirty, then keep flushing </li></ul></li><li>It is important that you have the hose on the frame tube hose when you start it.  Coolant flows IN that way, and OUT the thermostat hose. </li></ul><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
