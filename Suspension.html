This appears to be inherent and probably is due to flexing of forks, frame, or both. Wobble under other conditions indicates that repairs or adjustments are needed somewhere. Diagnosis is as follows: <ul><li>Check that the steering head bearings aren't loose. This is probably the most   common cause of front end wobble. </li><li>Check that the tire pressure, especially the front, is at least up to the recommended level. If you are heavier than average or carrying a load, the pressure may need to be higher. Some tires also seem to perform a little better with slightly higher than recommended pressures. </li><li>Check the condition of the tires, especially the front, for "scalloping" or other uneven wear. </li><li>Make sure they are installed in the correct direction of  rotation. Loosen all the triple clamp bolts and make sure there is absolutely no "stress" on either fork tube. Check that the fork tubes are straight while you're at it. </li><li>Check that the handlebars are straight, then re-tighten the triple clamp bolts. If the fork tubes are not even with the top of the triple clamp, make that adjustment prior to tightening. </li><li>Once you're sure it is not any of the above, you're down to other, less likely items. Systematically check everything that affects damping or could develop excessive tolerances or become misaligned in both the front and rear suspension: <ul><li>wheel bearings </li><li>fork bushings </li><li>fork oil (you do have fresh fork oil, don't you?) </li><li>swingarm bushings </li><li>front/rear wheel alignment </li><li>wheel runout </li></ul></ul><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
