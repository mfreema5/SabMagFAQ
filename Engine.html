<ul><li>Top <ul><li>Valve Cover Oil Leak <ul><li>The valve covers are held in place by rubber washers below a chrome washer - which are held in place by the valve cover bolts.  The bolts put pressure on the rubber washers - which in turn puts pressure on the valve cover gaskets.  Over time, the rubber washers and/or the valve cover gaskets lose their elasticity and don't compress as much - allowing an oil leak.  Tightening the valve cover bolts does not do any good as they are designed to bottom out in the head.  Attempting to tighten them usually results in snapping their head off. <ul><li>Valve cover gasket replacement is usually not required. </li></ul></li><li>The solution (besides purchasing new valve cover gaskets and/or rubber washers) is to purchase normal hose washers from your local hardware store.  These are then placed under the chrome washer but ON TOP of the rubber washer.  Then tighten the valve cover bolts until either they bottom out in the head or until the valve cover gasket bulges SLIGHTLY.  The valve cover gasket should not bulge past the edge of the valve cover and head. </li><li>Concern has been expressed over the construction of the hose washers not being robust enough to handle the heat from the engine.  Nylon white, hard washers have been also used (1" OD x 7/16th ID x 1/8ths thick ) </li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="gap">Right <ul><li>Clutch Cover Oil leak <ul><li>The clutch cover gasket can leak if the surfaces are not cleaned well enough prior to installing another gasket.  Before installing a gasket, ensure both mating surfaces are shiny aluminum.  If it is not shiny, it is not clean.  Oil one side of the gasket so it will not tear if you remove the clutch cover in the future. </li><li>Do NOT use an aftermarket clutch cover gasket.  Use OEM.  The tolerances for this cover/gasket are very exact and variances can cause issues.  Too thin a gasket could cause the starter gear to bind.  Too think a gasket could cause the starter gear to rattle. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="gap">Left </li><li class="gap">Bottom </li></ul><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
